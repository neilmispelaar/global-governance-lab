<p>The Peruvian Amazon Rural Livelihoods and Poverty (PARLAP) Project is a large-scale study of rural poverty among both folk and indigenous people in western Amazonia. Rural people in Amazonia are typically poor and rely heavily on rain forest resources to make their living. Understanding poverty in biologically rich areas of the Amazon basin is important not only for informing conservation initiatives but also for social policy to improve the well-being of rain forest peoples. This multi-year study is based on the most extensive rural community and household survey undertaken in Amazonia.</p>
