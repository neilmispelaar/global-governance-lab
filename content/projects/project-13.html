<p><em>Justice and Reconciliation in World Politics</em> is a study in normative and critical theory of how to conceptualize practices of justice and reconciliation that aim to respond to colonial injustices in international and transnational contexts. Examining cases of colonial war, genocide, forced sexual labour, forcible incorporation, and dispossession, this book highlights the structural injustices involved in colonialism, based on race, class, and gender, and shows that interactional practices of justice and reconciliation have been inadequate in redressing these structural injustices. The book argues that contemporary moral/political projects of justice and reconciliation in response to the persistent structural injustices of a colonial international order entail strategies of decolonization, decentering, and disalienation that go beyond interactional practices of accountability and reparation, beyond victims and perpetrators, and beyond a statist world order. It has been published in 2017 (Cambridge University Press) and won the <em>2018 Robert L. Jervis and Paul W. Schroeder Best Book Award</em> in International History and Politics of the American Political Science Association, as well as the 2018 <em>Sussex International Theory</em> Prize, awarded by the Centre for Advanced International Theory at the University of Sussex.</p>
