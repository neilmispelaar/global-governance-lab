<p>In 2016-2017, Eric Hirsch was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Global Governance at the Institute for the Study of International Development.  Dr. Hirsch is an environmental and economic anthropologist whose work focuses on highlands in Peru and the islands that make up the Maldives. While at <abbr>ISID</abbr>, he worked on a book titled "Investing in Indigeneity: Development and the Politics of Abundance in Peru." Based on over two years’ total of longitudinal ethnography in Peru, this book investigates the relationship between small-scale development financing, environmental adaptation, and the economic making of indigenous lives in Andean Peru's Arequipa region.  His specific focus was a network of agricultural villages in the Colca Valley closely linked to the city of Arequipa. He found that development institutions’ emphases on harnessing what they saw as abundant sources of human capital, ecological expertise, and entrepreneurial capacity belied basic material scarcities resulting from climate change and state disinvestment.</p>

<p>During his time at <abbr>ISID</abbr>, he also expanded his research by pursuing broader interests in resource governance, climate change, and the new ways extraction is happening around the world. His three specific projects were: 1) comparing concepts of "resilience" between the Andes and the Maldives; 2) analyzing a case study of informal mining in Peru; and 3) collaborating with postdoc advisor Ismael Vaccaro (McGill) and our colleague Irene Sabaté (Universitat Barcelona) on a project looking at debt and development in Peru and Spain.</p>
