<p>From 2016 to 2018, Katherine Bersch was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Global Governance at the Institute for the Study of International Development. While at ISID, she worked on the preparation of a book, "When Democracies Deliver: Governance Reform in Latin America" and expanding of her work on the State Capacity Project.  Her book assesses two competing approaches to public administration reform. Drawing on eighteen months of field research in Argentina and Brazil, she argues that the dominant approach among many Latin American policymakers and international organizations—namely, swift, wholesale reform pushed through by political leaders during "windows of opportunity"-does not tend to produce lasting improvements, and that incremental changes sequenced over time have been more effective and enduring. Unlike silver-bullet solutions, gradual reform allows for modifications and corrections along the way and does not depend on finding <em>the</em> right solution <em>ex ante</em>, a notoriously difficult task in the complex world of policy making. Drawing on cognitive-psychological insights about decision making, her political theory of reform explains why certain strategies result in enduring improvements and how political conditions influence the adoption of such successful strategies.</p>

<p>In her second research agenda, she analyzes the variation of bureaucratic capacity and political autonomy <em>within</em> national governments and evaluates the implications for effective governance and democratic performance. In a series of publications and working papers with Matthew Taylor and Sergio Praça, they use novel individual-level data on the careers and political affiliations of 326,000 civil servants to produce objective measures of state capacity and political autonomy for 95 Brazilian federal agencies. They applied Bayesian latent variable analysis, which she first used in her article with Sandra Botero, "Measuring Governance: Implications of Conceptual Choices," published in the <em>European Journal of Development Research</em> (2014). The application of this method to map bureaucratic capacity and political autonomy of Brazilian federal agencies was presented as a chapter in <em>State Building in the Developing World</em>, edited by Miguel Centeno, Atul Kohli, and Deborah Yashar (Cambridge 2017). They used this mapping of Brazil’s civil service apparatus to examine how capacity, autonomy, and political dominance affect corruption. The resulting article received the Best Paper Award from the Latin American Studies Association Political Institutions section and was published in <em>Governance</em> (2017).</p>
