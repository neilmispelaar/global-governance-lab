<p>S.P. Harish was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Global Governance at the Institute for the Study of International Development.  During his time at <abbr>ISID</abbr>, he worked on a book project on the effect of pre-colonial institutions in Southeast Asia. Using a combination of qualitative, quantitative and archival data, he studied how pre-colonial institutions continue to play a key role in the economic and political arena in the region. The findings have implications for state-formation, economic growth and democratic rule for post-colonial countries.</p>

<p>S.P. Harish specializes in comparative politics with an emphasis on state capacity, nation-building, political violence and energy access, especially in Southeast and South Asia. In recent work on Timor-Leste, he presents a theory of how exposure to violence exacerbates the gender divide in Timor-Leste. Using a novel dataset that documents human rights violations in Timor-Leste during the Indonesian occupation and a household survey, he shows that the negative impact of war affects not only people who were exposed to the violence but also extends to the next generation. Importantly, he shows that this only affects female children in the next generation, thereby exacerbating the gender divide. He provides a causal mechanism using an overlapping generations model and associated empirical evidence through which this effect sustains for more than one generation. Specifically, he shows how households that are exposed to violence make allocation decisions that are more in favor of their sons rather than their daughters compared to other households.</p>

<p>In additional projects, S.P. Harish examines how female leadership influences a stateâ€™s tendency to engage in conflict; how education policies overcome ethnic divisions in Thailand; and the determinants of election-violence in Indonesia. His work on the electoral violence cycle (co-authored with Andrew Little) is published in the <em>American Political Science Review</em>.</p>
