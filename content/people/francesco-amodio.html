<p>Francesco Amodio is Assistant Professor at McGill University in Montreal, jointly appointed by the Department of Economics and the Institute for the Study of International Development. He earned his Ph.D. in Economics from Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona in 2015. Professor Amodio is an applied microeconomist with a strong interest in development economics and its intersections with labor economics and political economy. His research is organized around two main pillars. One of them is the study of market frictions and their impact on the productivity and efficiency of organizations, focusing on developing countries. His other area of research investigates the political economy of conflict. He studies the determinants of political violence, and the relationship between formal and informal institutions in shaping market outcomes, inequality and welfare in Sub-Saharan African democracies.</p>
