<p>In 2015-16, Zinaida Miller was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Global Governance at the Institute for the Study of International Development.  During her time at <abbr>ISID</abbr>, she worked on a book that examines the different conceptions of justice, law, and political economy that underpin expert interventions in the aftermath of conflict and analyzes how those preconceptions affect the possibilities for sustainable peace and development.</p>

<p>Her scholarship focuses on the conceptualization, management, and regulation of post-conflict territories and populations, particularly in the areas of human rights, humanitarian aid, and transitional justice. She examines the relationships among local and international legal regimes and experts in moments of conflict and post-conflict transition, focusing on continuities of inequality and structural violence. Miller's publications include articles on the exclusion of economic issues from transitional justice and the influence of international ideas about law, humanitarianism, and development on Palestinian governance, among others. Her co-edited collection, Anti-Impunity and the Human Rights Agenda (with Karen Engle and Dennis Davis), explores the increasing emphasis on punishment and prosecution in the human rights movement, particularly in states emerging from conflict.</p>
