<p>Forced migration and the destruction, confiscation, and transaction of Housing, Land and Property (HLP) in war-affected environments present a primary development challenge to displaced populations, host communities, governments, and international organizations, as well as durable peace and recovery in war-torn societies. Despite innumerable obstacles, experiences from multiple conflict-affected contexts show that displaced people employ a variety of local and mobile-based communication strategies to monitor HLP and prepare for eventual return. In this project, researchers Emily Frank, Matthew F. Pritchard, and Jon D. Unruh (DDHLP) develop a mobile and web-based platforms which address three primary obstacles that face displaced populations and large-scale HLP restitution programs: 1) displaced populations are often reluctant to return to home areas if they know their HLP has been destroyed or occupied by others; 2) those returning can be ill-equipped to prepare evidence and organize claims, and often experience highly compromised livelihoods; 3) the time (often years) required to develop and implement mass claims techniques can discourage return or encourage claimants to seek less peaceful forms of resolution.</p>

<p>Currently, planning and organizing large-scale HLP restitution processes begin well after a war is over, and rely overwhelmingly on a set of transitional justice measures. DDHLP’s app and web-based platforms begin this process while conflict is on-going, increasing awareness of HLP procedures, as well as organizing and corroborating evidence that will facilitate return and other viable remedies. Indeed, traditional and non-traditional forms of evidence catalogued using DDHLP app and web platform can be used to support HLP claims and resolve dispute.  DDHLP’s platform instruct displaced people about information that can be used as evidence in HLP claims.  The app and web platform also provide information about relevant HLP legislation, and help connect displaced populations with key actors and institutions.</p>
