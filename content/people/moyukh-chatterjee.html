<p>From 2015 to 2017, Moyukh Chatterjee was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Global Governance at the Institute for the Study of International Development. As a social anthropologist, Chatterjee focuses on the ethnography of law, violence, state and politics. While at ISID, Chatterjee worked on his book manuscript, “The Impunity Effect: Spectacular Violence and Democracy in India”.  The book is based on ethnographic research conducted in Gujarat between 2011-13, and is part of a decade long project to understand the relationship between collective violence, public legitimacy, and political power in India. While communal riots and ethnic violence are often described in the media as the breakdown of law and order, and activists and civil society rely on courts for justice, Chatterjee's work shows how lower courts often immunize perpetrators from prosecution.</p>

<p>He shows how state and non-state actors draw on everyday law in India to repackage anti-minority violence to reinforce and deepen state power. Drawing on Chatterjee's decade long engagement with activists, lawyers, survivors, and paralegals in Gujarat, the book reveals a distinctive style of postcolonial governance, one that is based on the ability of a range of political actors to reconcile majoritarian rule with everyday legality. Some parts of this project have appeared in anthropology and interdisciplinary journals, including <em>American Ethnologist</em>, <em>Economic and Political Weekly</em>, <em>Distinktion: A Journal of Social Theory</em>, <em>and Law</em>, <em>Culture and the Humanities</em>.</p>
