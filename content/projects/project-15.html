<h3 class="pb-2">Project Description</h3>

<p>The project involves providing training workshops and continuous support to the University of Mandalay as well as the Myanmar Development Institute (<abbr>MDI</abbr>) in Nay Pyi Taw. Expanding the research and analytical capacity of these stakeholders requires offering a targeted approach to take into account the differences emanating from their mandates, roles and nature.</p>

<p>The Myanmar Development Institute is a government office that targets policy analysis by government officials to guide ministers in their policies, whereas the University of Mandalay has a general mandate of education and broad research. The training needs of the personnel are also quite different, with the University of Mandalay requiring broad analytical skills in social sciences and MDI officials more specific training in econometrics and impact evaluation. In collaboration with Thailand’s Chiang Mai University, McGill researchers will provide on the ground and web-based support.</p>

<p>This project is under the umbrella of <em>Canada’s Knowledge for Democracy Myanmar initiative</em>. This initiative, an IDRC and Global Affairs Canada partnership, seeks to support democratic transition in Myanmar through policy research.</p>
