<p>We are pleased to announce a new multidisciplinary partnership between McGill University and the UN Environment on a research to practice agenda on natural resource conflict mediation and prevention. With global trends such as population growth, biodiversity loss and climate change, competition over scarce resources is intensifying and consequently creating new conflicts or exacerbating existing ones. By combining McGill researchers’ and the UN’s expertise and resources, this collaboration has potential to influence global policy and reduce environment-related risks. The partnership seeks to establish a process that will enhance capacity to identify environment-related threats to human security and monitor the interaction between environmental factors and political or social tensions at regional, national and global levels.</p>
